Release history
===============

Here is a list of changes that happened in each release of [Coquelicot]:

Version 0.9.5
-------------

 * Fix preselection of the expiration time set in the configuration.
 * Remove usage of the deprecated $.browser in jQuery plugins. This
   makes them compatible with jQuery 1.9+.
 * Upgrade bundled jQuery to version 1.11.3.
 * Add missing `require` for some Cucumber features.

Released 2015-09-22.

Version 0.9.4
-------------

 * Make the directory for cache files configurable. This adds a new
   `cache_path` setting. Thanks to Rowan Thorpe for the original patch.
 * Make the default selection for the expiration time match the default
   setting.
 * Switch the default expiration time to one day. This should be less surprising
   to users uploading huge files. Thanks drkvg for prodding me long enough
   to do this.
 * Stop IMAP and LDAP authenticators to error out when authentication fails. They
   now properly just deny the authentication requests as they should have.
 * Make sure that we read and write binary files as such. This should improve
   compatibilities with certain Ruby installations.
 * Do proper integration testing using Cucumber.
 * Update and clean up dependencies.
 * Other minor improvements:
   - Upgrade to RSpec 3 and fix the remaining deprecation warnings.
   - Specify the license in the gemspec.
   - Explicitly require on tilt/haml and tilt/sass to avoid race conditions.

Released 2015-09-12.

Version 0.9.3
-------------

 * Support sub-directory installations. See updated installation
   documentation for Apache and the new `path` setting.
 * Always use the current source tree as the `coquelicot` gem.
 * Fix an issue with the signature step in the release process.
 * Document commands needed to serve the local Git clone.

   Garreau for reporting the issue.

 * Stop spilling authentication errors to users. Thanks Rowan Thorpe for
   the report.
 * Add LDAP authentication (with uid lookup). Thanks Rowan Thorpe!
 * Code cleanups:
   - Drop support for Ruby 1.8.
   - Stop using unsupported gem name for `activesupport`.

Version 0.9.2
-------------

 * Minor code cleanups:
   - Cleanup old stub launcher for `Coquelicot::Application`.
   - Fallback on version available in source code when the gem version is
     unavailable.
   - Add missing require for `Coquelicot::Helpers`.
   - Ensure gem files have been unlinked after they have been sent.
     Files created with Tempfile should be unlinked by Ruby runtime,
     but let's just do it when most appropriate.
 * Source tarball cleanup:
   - Stop shipping jquery.lightBoxFu.js with the executable bit set.
   - Ship proper "mtimes" instead of setting every dates to 1970-01-01.
 * Mention author and license for JavaScript libraries in README.
 * Document the release process.
 * Rework and split documentation in different files targeting different
   audiences.
